# Movies---Extract-Transform-Load-ETL-

This project was created in order to sift through large amounts of movie data from
- Wikipedia
- Kaggle metadata 
- MovieLens rating data.

The purpose of this project was to use ETL method to sift through data.
Our initial step was to clean the data and then reduce the size of the large sets of data.
We would use the data then to load in tables that we created.
Then we load the data from our Juypter Notebook to PostgresSQL Movie database in order to create more ways to inspect the data.
