# Movies---Extract-Transform-Load-ETL-

This project was created in order to sift through large amounts of movie data from
- Wikipedia
- Kaggle metadata 
- MovieLens rating data.

## Outline

The purpose of this project was to use ETL method to sift through data.
Our initial step was to clean the data and then reduce the size of the large sets of data.
We would use the data then to load in tables that we created.
Then we load the data from our Juypter Notebook to PostgresSQL Movie database in order to create more ways to inspect the data. 

## Problems Faced:

I had a lot of difficulties with deliverable 4 and section 8.5.2. I was not able to get over constant error messages I was receiving regarding "from config import db_password." I believe there is a lack of understanding on loading datasets into postgreSQL and I will reach out for more assistance regarding this.
